    Called from every stage's epoch loop (see train_ae.py/train_lds.py/
    train_refinement.py) so the visualization and its y-axis-saturation
    behavior stay in exactly one place rather than being reimplemented
    slightly differently per stage.

    train_loss/val_loss/best_so_far: one value per epoch so far, in
    order -- best_so_far is the running minimum of val_loss's OWN
    criterion (see CheckpointCriterionTracker), i.e. what actually
    decides whether a checkpoint gets saved, not just min(val_loss) up
    to that point (during a warmup phase the two can differ).

    secondary_train/secondary_val: for stages with more than one loss
    scale worth watching together (currently just train_lds() at
    n_rollout_steps>1: 1step alongside the full rollout loss -- at
    n_rollout_steps=1 the two are identical, so this is skipped, same
    condition as the console's own show_1step). Plotted as thinner,
    dashed lines so the primary loss stays visually dominant.

    Y-axis capped at 2x the FIRST epoch's train_loss, but ONLY when the
    data actually exceeds that cap -- multi-step rollout training in
    particular is prone to large, transient early spikes (seen
    repeatedly in this project's own stage-3b runs) that would otherwise
    stretch the y-axis so far that the later, more informative
    convergence behavior gets squashed into an unreadable flat line near
    zero. When nothing in the run actually reaches 2x the first epoch's
    loss, the cap is skipped entirely and the axis auto-scales to the
    real range instead -- always applying the cap regardless of whether
    it was needed just stretches well-behaved runs unnecessarily, hiding
    real (if small) variation in the same way an unwarranted spike-driven
    stretch would. Deliberately based on train_loss[0] specifically (not
    the max seen so far) -- a fixed, predictable reference, same
    reasoning as check_rollout.py's real-Delta-x-derived scales: capping
    at the observed max would just chase whatever the worst spike happens
    to be, defeating the point of a stable, comparable scale.
